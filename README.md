# AviUtl_translator
First release. GUI is written in English.
__Actually, it's not a trasnlator, but it's a trasnlation helper.__
So it dosen't traslate automatically, and you have to do little bit of copy-paste work.
It's not working in all script, and pretty complicate to use it properly.
If you have any question, please ask to my twitter @webcam_ytp
